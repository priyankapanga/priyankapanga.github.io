#### üîç [Intent Classifier with DistilBERT Transformer](https://bert-intent-classification.streamlit.app/)

  <img src="images/intentclassifier_landingpage.png" height="300" width="600"/>

**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace, Streamlit

 Built and deployed a **DistilBERT-based text classification** model on the SNIPS dataset with **7 possible
user-intents**, achieving **95.73% accuracy**
- Implemented data preprocessing, tokenization, and stratified train/validation/test splits in both Logistic
Rgression and DistilBERT using **Pandas, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face Datasets**
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT with Hugging Face Transformers and **visualized results with confusion matrices**
and classification reports, also **comparing performance tradeoffs**
- **Deployed model on Hugging Face Hub** and built an **interactive Streamlit app** for real-time intent
prediction

#### üé• [Studio Ghibli Films Revenue Analysis](https://priyankapanga-studio-ghibli-revenue-analysis.streamlit.app)

  <img src="images/totoro_hires_1_7dc984c6-a680-4b5e-ac19-642c5e7617ce.png" width="600"/>

**Tools:** SQL (SQLite), Python (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn), Streamlit, Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Google Sheets  
I explored what makes a Studio Ghibli film successful at the box office by cleaning and analyzing a custom dataset of their movies.  
- Queried data using **SQLite** and **DB Browser**
- Processed and visualized data using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**
- Built an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**
- Visualized trends with **Seaborn**, **Excel**, and **Google Sheets**  
-> The dataset gained **50+ downloads on Kaggle**, showing strong community interest.

#### üö¢ [Titanic Survival Prediction: Random Forest vs Logistic Regression](https://github.com/priyankapanga/Titanic-Survival-Prediction)

   <img src="images/how-to-draw-the-titanic-titanic_5e4c8e261e6bd8.95988569_34328_3_4.jpg" width="600"/>

**Tools:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks 
- Used **scikit-learn** to compare **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models  
- Found Logistic Regression was **2.3% more accurate**  
- Visualized trends and survival patterns using **Seaborn** in Jupyter Notebooks
